    <h1><b>   CLASSICAL MUSIC  </b></h1>
    <h2><b>   Classical Music: An Overview  </b></h2>
    <P> 
Classical music generally refers to the art music of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions. It is a broad term for music that originated in Western culture and follows certain rules of composition, harmony, and style.<br><br>
Often it is characterized by formality and complexity in its musical form and harmonic organization, particularly with the use of polyphony.
Classical music is typically considered music made before the 19th century, whereas modern music is music created after the 19th century.

    Both the English term <b>"classical"</b> and the German equivalent <b>klassik</b> developed from the French <i>classique</i>, itself derived from the Latin word <b><i>classicus</b></i>, which originally referred to the highest class of Ancient Roman citizens.<br>
In 1879 the composer Charles Kensington Salaman defined the following composers as classical:</p>
    <P1>Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Spohr and Mendelssohn.</p>   
    
    <P>The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) offers three definitions for the word "classical" in relation to music.<br>
    "of acknowledged excellence"<br>
    "of, relating to, or characteristic of a formal musical tradition, as distinguished from popular or folk music"and more specifically,<br>
    "of or relating to formal European music of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, characterized by harmony, balance, and adherence to established   compositional forms".<br>
The last definition concerns what is now termed the Classical period, a specific stylistic era of European music from the second half of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
